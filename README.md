# Solution_Challenge-TEC-Prediction
The TEC in the ionosphere is modified by changing solar Extreme UV radiation, geomagnetic storms, and the atmospheric waves that propagate up from the lower atmosphere. Therefore depend on season, geomagnetic conditions, solar cycle and activity which impact climate change.
